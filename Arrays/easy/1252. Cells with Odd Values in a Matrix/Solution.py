# There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

# For each location indices[i], do both of the following:

#     Increment all the cells on row ri.
#     Increment all the cells on column ci.

# Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
# After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
# The final matrix is [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]], which contains 6 odd numbers.

# Example 2:

# Input: m = 2, n = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There are no odd numbers in the final matrix.
